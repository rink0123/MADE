# Pinterest Clone

You can view it live [here](https://pinterest-clone.bitballoon.com/), although for the most recent version, fork and clone the repo.

This project is just a fun way to test my skills by recreating the styling (and hopefully function) of Pinterest's website.

## Languages

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Libraries

- jQuery

## Goals

I want to complete this project without using outside styling libraries or frameworks-- for example without Bootstrap.
As of now, this project does use jQuery but I will be refactoring it out.

## Todo

- Modals from the navbar
- User input to add a Pin

### Icebox

- Node.js backend
